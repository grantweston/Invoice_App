# Prompting and LLM Interaction Guidelines

## Prompt Templates

**1-Minute Video Summary Prompt**:
You are analyzing a 1-minute video of the user's computer screen, focusing on accounting tasks. Summarize the activity, mentioning clients, projects, and key actions.


**15-Minute Aggregation Prompt**:
Combine these fifteen 1-minute summaries into one coherent 15-minute summary. Mention clients, projects, and main tasks, in under 3 sentences.


**Daily Aggregation Prompt**:
Aggregate multiple 15-minute summaries by client and project. Output in JSON: { "client_name": { "project_name": { "total_time_hours": number, "description": "string" } } }


**Invoice Generation Prompt**:
Given hours worked, client details, and invoice template placeholders, produce line items and a formal project description.
