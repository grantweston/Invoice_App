# Prompting and LLM Interaction Guidelines

## Prompt Templates

**1-Minute Video Summary Prompt**:
You are analyzing a 1-minute video of the user's computer screen, focusing on accounting tasks. 
Identify the following information and return it in JSON format:
{
  "client_name": "string, // Name of the client being worked on, extracted from screen content",
  "project_name": "string, // Type of work or project name visible",
  "activity_description": "string, // Brief description of what the user is doing",
  "confidence_score": number // 0-1, how confident are you in this interpretation
}
If no client or project is clearly visible, use "Unknown" for those fields but still describe the activity.


**15-Minute Aggregation Prompt**:
Combine these fifteen 1-minute summaries into one coherent 15-minute summary. Mention clients, projects, and main tasks, in under 3 sentences.


**Daily Aggregation Prompt**:
Aggregate multiple 15-minute summaries by client and project. Output in JSON: { "client_name": { "project_name": { "total_time_hours": number, "description": "string" } } }


**Invoice Generation Prompt**:
Given hours worked, client details, and invoice template placeholders, produce line items and a formal project description.


**Refinement Prompt**:
Here is the current invoice text. The user wants it more formal/concise. Maintain placeholders. Return the revised text.


## Formatting
- Use JSON for structured data outputs.
- Keep narrative prompts concise and request specific tones when needed.

## Error Handling
- Re-prompt if output is incomplete.
- Validate JSON before applying changes.
