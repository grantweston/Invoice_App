# Technical Requirements and Specifications

(DONE) This document now reflects the new Next.js 13 App Router structure, with API routes under `app/api/`.

## Architecture Overview
- **Front-End**: Next.js 13 (App Router)
- **LLM**: Google Gemini API
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres)
- **Google Workspace**: Docs/Sheets APIs

## Data Flow
1. **Screen Capture**: Captures each minute.
2. **LLM Summarization**: Every 15 minutes, summaries are generated and stored.
3. **Daily Aggregation**: Triggered by user pressing "End Work Session" on the WIP dashboard (`app/page.tsx`).  
   - A POST request to `/api/dailyReport` now forces aggregation of today's WIP data.
   - The aggregation uses Supabase queries to fetch today's entries, groups them, calls the LLM for a description, and stores the result in `daily_aggregations`.
4. **Client/Project Storage**: Data stored in Supabase. 
5. **Invoice Generation**: `/api/invoice` handles invoice creation, retrieval, and updates.
6. **Editing Workflow**: `app/invoice/[id]/page.tsx` allows refinement via LLM chat and opening Google Docs.

## API Routes
- **/api/timeEntries**: GET lists entries, POST creates an entry.
- **/api/invoice**: GET fetches an invoice, POST creates one, PATCH updates it.
- **/api/dailyReport**: GET fetches today's aggregated data, POST triggers re-aggregation.
- **/api/clientData**: GET client/project details.
- **/api/markPaid**: POST marks an invoice as paid.

## Environment Variables
As documented in `docs/6.DEPLOYMENT_AND_DEVOPS.md`, ensure all keys are set in `.env.local`.

## Performance & Scaling
The logic remains scalable with Supabase and serverless Next.js routes. LLM calls are external and can be cached if needed.
