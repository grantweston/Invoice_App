# Technical Requirements and Specifications

## Architecture Overview
- **Front-End**: Next.js 13 (App Router)
- **LLM**: Google Gemini API
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres)
- **Google Workspace**: Docs/Sheets APIs

## Data Flow
1. **Screen Capture**: Captures each minute.
2. **LLM Summarization**: Every 15 minutes, summaries are generated and stored.
3. **Daily Aggregation**: Triggered by user pressing "End Work Session" on the WIP dashboard. This action calls a server endpoint to produce a daily summary.
4. **Client/Project Storage**: Stored in Supabase and optionally Sheets.
5. **Invoice Generation**: Convert aggregated data into a Google Doc invoice.
6. **Editing Workflow**: Users can refine invoices via LLM chat or open the doc in Google Docs.

## Front-End Enhancements
- A "Begin Work Session" and "End Work Session" button have been added on the main WIP dashboard (`app/page.tsx`):
  - **Begin Work Session**: Sets up the start of the workday (placeholder for future expansion).
  - **End Work Session**: Triggers daily report generation, summarizing all WIP entries for the day.

## Performance & Scaling
- The integration remains the same.

## Environment Variables
- Documented in `docs/6.DEPLOYMENT_AND_DEVOPS.md`.
- Ensures Supabase, Gemini, and Google credentials are loaded from `.env`.
