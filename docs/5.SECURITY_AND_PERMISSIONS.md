# Security and Permissions (Demo-Scale)

## Authentication & Access
- Minimal for the demo, possibly a single user.
- Keep API keys in `.env`.
- Future: Add OAuth or JWT if multi-user support grows.

## Data Protection
- HTTPS for all API requests.
- Supabase keys secured in environment variables.

## Google Workspace Permissions
- Use least privileges required.
- Store and refresh tokens securely.

## Logging & Auditing
- Minimal logging for debugging.
- Scale up security monitoring if productized.
