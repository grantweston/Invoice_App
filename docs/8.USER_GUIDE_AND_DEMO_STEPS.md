# User Guide and Demo Steps

(DONE) Updated to reflect the new workflow with `/api/dailyReport`.

## Basic Usage
1. **Start Work**: Click “Begin Work Session” on the homepage (`app/page.tsx`) to start tracking work.
2. **View WIP**: As you work, WIP entries appear on the homepage.
3. **End Work Session**: When you finish for the day, click “End Work Session”.  
   - This now sends a POST request to `/api/dailyReport` to trigger an immediate aggregation of all today's entries.
   - After completion, the user is redirected to `/daily-report` to view the newly aggregated data.

## Editing and Refinement
- Access invoice or report pages under `app/invoice/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Use LLM chat to refine invoice text. The doc updates automatically.
- Click “Open in Google Docs” if needed for manual edits.

## Generating Invoices
- From WIP or client detail pages, generate invoices via `/api/invoice`.
- Then refine using LLM or Google Docs.

## Marking Invoices as Paid
- Use `/api/markPaid` POST endpoint from the invoice view to mark as paid, updating related entries.

## Demo Script
- Begin the day: “Begin Work Session.”
- Simulate work: WIP entries appear.
- End the day: “End Work Session” triggers `/api/dailyReport` POST for aggregation.
- Go to `/daily-report` to see updated data.
- Produce invoice and refine it.
