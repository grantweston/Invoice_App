# Project Overview & Vision

## Vision & Goals
This application is designed to streamline the generation of Work-In-Process (WIP) reports and automate the creation of client invoices based on observed work. By leveraging Google’s Gemini LLM to interpret screen activity, we can produce near-real-time WIP data and seamlessly aggregate daily work into consolidated timesheets and invoices. Our aim is to reduce administrative overhead for professional services firms, enabling them to focus on their core accounting tasks.

## Problem Statement
Manual time tracking and invoice generation are time-consuming and prone to error. By automating the capture of billable hours and simplifying the invoice creation process, we free accounting professionals from non-billable clerical work and enhance the accuracy and consistency of billing.

## Target Users
- **Accountants** who log hours performing tax, audit, or consulting tasks.
- **Partners/Managers** who review WIP, oversee projects, and approve invoices.
- **Billing Specialists** responsible for sending invoices and ensuring prompt payment.

## Key Benefits
- **Automated Data Capture**: Continuous monitoring translates screen activity into WIP entries.
- **Aggregated Summaries**: Combine multiple short intervals into coherent daily project summaries.
- **Invoice Generation**: Easily convert daily summaries into professional invoices with LLM-driven narrative content.
- **Modern Web Stack**: Built with Next.js 13’s App Router, Supabase, and Google Workspace APIs for a seamless, future-proof solution.

## Success Criteria
- Accurate capture of time spent, aggregated into a daily WIP report.
- On-demand invoice generation using pre-defined templates.
- Flexible editing workflows via Google Docs and LLM-driven text refinement.
- A user-friendly, modern UI following Next.js 13 conventions.
