# Testing and Validation Plan

## Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Validate LLM prompt formatting, database queries, invoice calculations.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure correct interaction between WIP entries, aggregation logic, and invoice generation.
- **E2E Tests**: Simulate a user completing a full day of work, generating a daily report, and creating an invoice.

## Tools
- Jest or Vitest for unit tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests against the Next.js front-end.
- Mock LLM and Google API responses for predictable outcomes.

## Sample Test Cases
- **Time Entry Creation**: Verify that after 15 min, a WIP entry is stored correctly.
- **Daily Aggregation**: Check JSON output for correct total hours.
- **Invoice Generation**: Confirm invoice placeholders are filled correctly and LLM refinement works.

## Validation
- Validate JSON outputs from LLM.
- Confirm invoice totals match expected hours * rate.
- Ensure UI updates automatically to reflect LLM-driven doc changes.
